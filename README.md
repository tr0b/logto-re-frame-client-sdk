## WARNING ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS (WIP) LIBRARY FOR MY OWN, PERSONAL USE. IT IS CURRENTLY UNTESTED AND LITERALLY ~~95%~~ 25% (AS OF May 5th 2025) OF THE CODE WAS GENERATED VIA LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.7), AS I WAS IN A RUSH TO HAVE A WORKING, AUTH FRAMEWORK INTEGRATED DIRECTLY WITH CLOJURE(SCRIPT). THIS LIBRARY MIGHT BE SUBJECTED TO RE-WRITES (OR POTENTIAL DEPRECATION) IN THE NEAR-FUTURE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY HARM, MISUSE OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE USAGE OF THIS LIBRARY.**

# Logto Client SDK for re-frame

This is a ClojureScript implementation of the Logto Client SDK for use with re-frame applications. It provides a clean, idiomatic way to integrate Logto authentication into your re-frame-based ClojureScript applications.

## Features

- Sign in Flow with OpenID
- Token management (ID tokens, access tokens, refresh tokens)
- Integration with re-frame

## Installation

~~Add the following dependency to your project.clj or deps.edn:~~ THERE'S NO INSTALLATION AVAILABLE ATM. YOU WILL HAVE TO COPY AND ADAPT ALL OF THE CODE AVAILABLE IN core.cljc INTO YOUR REFRAME PROJECT
